## Examples

### Basic Hooks

Learn how to use basic hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

- **useState**: State management in functional components.

- **useContext**: Consuming context in functional components.

### Context API

Understand how to use the Context API to manage global state in a React application.

- **Creating a Context**: Define a context to manage state.
- **Providing Context**: Use the `Provider` component to make the context available to the component tree.
- **Consuming Context**: Access the context value in child components.

### Advanced Topics

Explore more advanced topics in React to build robust applications.

- **Custom Hooks**: Create reusable logic with custom hooks.
- **useReducer**: Manage complex state logic with the `useReducer` hook.
- **React.memo**: Optimize performance by memoizing components.
- **React.lazy and Suspense**: Code-splitting and lazy loading components.
